  <p>I am currently an Assistant Professor at the University of Warwick at the Operations Research and Information Systems Management departments.
  Prior to this I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Computing at Imperial College London and the Scientific Computing department
  at CWI Amsterdam. I obtained my PhD cum laude from the University of Bologna in Financial Mathematics as part of a Marie-Curie ITN-EID project. 
  I have obtained my Master's degree in Quantitative Finance at the VU Amsterdam and my Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from the Delft 
  University of Technology.</p>

  <p> My research interests are in optimization and applied probability and the applications of these topics in machine learning, 
   human-centred systems, and finance. </p>
