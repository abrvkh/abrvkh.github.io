    <p class="myp"> I am currently an Assistant Professor (lecturer) at the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London and the
       <a href="https://ix.imperial.ac.uk/" style="text-decoraction:none; color: #ed517a">Imperial-X</a> initiative.
       I am looking for new PhD students (to start asap). If you are interested please get in touch!
    </p>

    <p class="myp"> My group works on computational models to understand and improve information processing in artificial
      and biological intelligent systems through a combination of tools from stochastic processes, statistical mechanics and 
      mathematical modeling. We apply this in i) explainable machine learning, ii) privacy-preserving machine learning and iii) neuroscience.
    </p>

    <p class="myp"> I also enjoy collaborating with industry on applied problems that use machine learning
      and optimization in for example finance, smart cities and healthcare. For potential collabs, please do reach out.  
    </p>

    <p class="myp"> Prior to my current position I was an Assistant Professor at the University of Warwick at the Operations Research department and
      did postdocs at Imperial College London and CWI Amsterdam. I obtained my PhD cum laude from the University of Bologna as part of a Marie-Curie ITN-EID project.
      My MSc was in Quantitative Finance at the VU Amsterdam and my BSc in Applied Mathematics from the Delft
      University of Technology.</p>
