    <p> From September 2022 I will be moving to Imperial College London to join the <a href="https://ix.imperial.ac.uk/" style="text-decoraction:none; color: #ed517a">Imperial-X</a> intiative.
       I am looking for new PhD students (to start in September 2022). If you are interested please get in touch!

    Prior to this I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Computing at Imperial College London and the Scientific Computing department
    at CWI Amsterdam. </p>

    <p> I obtained my PhD cum laude from the University of Bologna in Financial Mathematics as part of a Marie-Curie ITN-EID project.
    I have obtained my Master's degree in Quantitative Finance at the VU Amsterdam and my Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from the Delft
