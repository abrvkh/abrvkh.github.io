## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="DSC08053_mod.jpeg">

I am an Assistant Professor (lecturer) in Machine Learning at the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London, affiliated with [Imperial-X](https://ix.imperial.ac.uk/).

## Research Interest

Very broadly speaking, I am interested in the principles that underlie cognition, both in nature and artificial. Some specific themes we work on:

* **Computationally constrained learning.** A recent and popular approach in the ML community is to simply increase the size of models and datasets (*GPT and the like*). In this case, the computational cost of running and training the models becomes a bottleneck. We look at: few-shot learning, spiking neural networks, optimise subsets of parameters or use only parts of the dataset (coresets), biologically plausible learning algorithms.
* **Training procedures for more robust learning.** The other approach is to cleverly modify the training procedures to learning more robust and generalisable representations of data. We look at: modifying the way we represent the data, contrastive loss approaches, active inference and Bayesian methods to represent uncertainties.

We work in close collaboration with **neuroscientists** to inspire new methodologies, as well as to apply ML methods to drive understanding into the mechanisms of the brain.
